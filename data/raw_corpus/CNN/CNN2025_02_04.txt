Australia bans DeepSeek on government devices over security concerns
Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices over concerns that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup behind it poses security risks, the government said Tuesday.

The Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs issued a mandatory direction for all government entities to prevent the use or installation of DeepSeek products, applications and web services and, where found, remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services from all Australian government systems and devices, the statement said.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said DeepSeek posed an unacceptable risk to government technology and the immediate ban was to protect Australias national security and national interest, several Australian media outlets reported Tuesday evening.

The ban does not extend to devices of private citizens.

Tech stocks worldwide plunged after the launch of DeepSeeks latest AI model last month  apparently costing a fraction of rival AI models and requiring less-sophisticated chips  raised questions over the Wests huge investments in chipmakers and data centers.

Australias decision to ban DeepSeek follows similar action in Italy, while other countries in Europe and elsewhere are also looking into the AI firm.

Taiwan banned government departments from using DeepSeeks AI service earlier this week.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese government imposed a government-wide ban on Chinese social media app TikTok two years ago over security concerns.
